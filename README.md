# Twitch-TV
 JSON API
Website based on Twich TV.
1) Check if freeCodeCamp is currently streaming
2) The click of the status output send user directly to the specific Twich.tv channel
3) If currently streaming -> show additional details

In the future I would like to implement:
) search box using Angular 2
) nav-bar to filter status all/online/offline
